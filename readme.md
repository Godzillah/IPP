#####  This is documentation about my semestral project from IPP. My process of doing this project was decomposed into few main parts.

# 1. Specifications

* As usual my first part was about design a specify specifications and then transform it to the programming part
* I was using Trello to write some checklists and i divided my project into logical parts.

# 2. Detailed design

* 1.part
    * writing in structural way
    * my plan was to do this with only using regexes
* 2.part
    * combination of OOP and structural
    * created class diagram and i was thinking about data structures which i will use in implementation was harder and my trello checklist was huge

### Class diagram

# 3.Implementation
* 1.part
    * i design finite-state machine with help of regexes and also functions to catch all errors 
    * detailed description is in the script
* 2.part
    * In this part i was using data structures like dictionaries , stacks , lists etc.
    * Python was new for me so all this stuff was a little bit tricky
    * Also in this part i designed finite-state machines with help of functions
    * MileStones :
        * Xml and Argument class
        * Error class
        * Frame classes
        * Instruction classes
        * Make 33 instructions (not done)
        * Arg Class
        
# 4.Testing 
   * When i reached milestone i immediately tested that concrete module

# Conclusion
   * I was great programming experienced for me and i learned a lot
   * Furthermore i discovered that ‚‚ A little knowledge is a dangerous thing‘‘.
   * My Advice for everybody is ‚; Broaden your horizons and be flexible‘‘
